# tweetbot
A Twitter bot is used to get information about the weather of a particular place. If @viveks_dev is used in the tweet and if the tweet contains the name of a place then it retweets the weather report

If you want to run it, change the file name (line number 41) accordingly.

tweet should contain "place:place_name" anywhere
