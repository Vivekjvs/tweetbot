# tweetbot
A Twitter bot is used to get information about the weather of a particular place. If @viveks_dev is used in the tweet and if the tweet contains the name of a place then it retweets the weather report

If you want to run it, change the file name (line number 41 of tweetbot.py file) accordingly.

While tweeting, just write the name of the place in the tweet.
